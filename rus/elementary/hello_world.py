# To print anything to the screen use print() function
# Examples:

print('example')
print("second example")
print("third", 'one')

### At this point you can already complete the task!

# Here are some details on what's going on

# When you type some characters inside a pair of parentheses
# you create an object of type 'str' that holds the string.

# After that you can link the object with a name:

a = 'some string'

# In this example we associate name 'a' with a string
# with a string 'some string'. Now we can pass it to print:

print(a)

# Or we could do that without an intermedeate step:

print('some string')
